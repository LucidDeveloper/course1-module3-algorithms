Practice Pseudocodes, Flowcharts, and Algorithms

# Assignment

Imagine you are a junior developer working for a financial technology company. Your team is tasked with developing a new feature for the companyâ€™s mobile banking app that enables users to set and track their savings goals.

Your specific responsibility is to develop the functionality for the savings goal tracking system. This system should be able to set new savings goals based on specific users and set dates to achieve said goals, as well as update the savings progress towards the goals. It should also include a user notification when a goal date is approaching and the savings has not been met.

In this lab, you will be writing pseudocode, defining basic commands, and developing a flowchart. These tasks will help you structure your approach to solving this problem and improve your understanding of programming.
